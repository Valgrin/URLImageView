# URLImageView

Write an Objective C class that implements a view for displaying an image that is asynchronously downloaded from a URL.
The class should expose a property for the image URL, and the download should be initiated when this property is set.
While the image is downloading, an activity indicator should be displayed.
You can use any of the standard UIKit/Cocoa frameworks.

Can you then use this class to parse and display some entries from the following feed: http://apps.aim-data.com/data/abc/triplej/onair.xml
